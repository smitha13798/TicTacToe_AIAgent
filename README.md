# MS AutoGen Dynamic Scenario Simulation

## Overview
This project leverages the power of MS AutoGen to create a dynamic scenario simulation that features intelligent agent interactions. The simulation utilizes a Python and AI Agents framework to demonstrate a unique setting where two agents engage in a discussion about a football match while concurrently playing a game of tic-tac-toe.

## Features
- **Dynamic Agent Interaction:** The agents simulate a conversation about a football match, showcasing their ability to adapt and respond in real-time.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Integration:** Alongside their discussion, the agents play a game of tic-tac-toe, demonstrating multitasking and strategic thinking.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Dependencies as listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
To run the simulation:
-Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
-Execute the notebook Tic_Tac_Toe.ipynb in a Jupyter environment or similar IDE that supports IPython Notebooks.

## How It Works
The simulation is built using the AI Agents framework which allows for the design and implementation of complex agent-based interactions. The agents in this simulation are programmed to discuss specific aspects of a football match while making moves in a tic-tac-toe game, demonstrating both natural language processing and decision-making capabilities.
